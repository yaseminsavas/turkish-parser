Project Title: Graph - Based BiLSTM in Turkish
Author: Yasemin SavaÅŸ - 54085

This project is based on this paper:
Paper Link: https://www.transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/viewFile/885/198
Github Repository: https://github.com/elikip/bist-parser

Notes:
1. I used GloVe embeddings from here: https://github.com/inzva/Turkish-GloVe

2. The implementation is based on PyTorch.

3. There are subtle differences between the original implementation and this repo.
(Learning rate is 0.001, MLP activations are ReLu, a weight decay exists, the loss is negative hinge embedding loss..)
